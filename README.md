# Building a Secure Event Driven Api for an Ecommerce Platform.

Congratulations, you have just created a Serverless "Hello World" application using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) for the `python3.10` runtime, and options to bootstrap it with [**Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python)**](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/latest/) (Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python)) utilities for Logging, Tracing and Metrics.

Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) is a developer toolkit to implement Serverless best practices and increase developer velocity.

## Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) features

Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) provides three core utilities:

- **[Tracing](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/latest/core/tracer/)** - Decorators and utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
- **[Logging](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/latest/core/logger/)** - Structured logging made easier, and decorator to enrich structured logging with key Lambda context details
- **[Metrics](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/latest/core/metrics/)** - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
